# VEHICLE PRICE PREDICTION
It is used for Predicting the price of the vehicle. Entering the details of the automobile and predicting the price of the car based on the company and the model of the car. It is created based on AI and machine learning assets and it is useful for buyers and sellers to know the price value of the car.predicts the price of the vehicle using linear regression model which identifies different patterns and projects and predicts the value of the vehicle.


# PROJECT SUMMARY


Predicting the car buyers whether they are willing to buy the cars or not.In this we have used attributes like make,body-style,wheel-base,engine-size,horsepower,highway-mpg,price,peak-rpm.If the customer want to buy a car,they need to do the following the steps that is carried out.That can be predicted from the resources which is given by the customer.


# AZURE SERVICES:


Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio this is a visual, drag-and-drop tool designed to help users build and deploy predictive analysis models with no coding required.Here the dataset is selected according to the needs.after the selection of the datasets and uploading it as csv file. Selecting the appropriate blocks for the model and male the connection and do the visualization for each blocks.

# DETAILED DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE PROJECT

Here we create the experiment and imported the data set from the file system.After creation of experiment here we dragging and placing the modules accordingly.
Here are the following modules which have been used are listed below:

# Dataset:


The datasets which have been used in the module are added  in the CSV file respectively.

# Editing Metadata:

It is used to update and change the type of blocks,etc.

# Splitting data:

It is used here to split the data for the training and evaluation.

# Scoring Model:

It provides the output a predicted value for the class, as well as the probability of the predicted value.Here we can visualize the datasets.

# Evaluate model:

Evaluate model gives the appropriate values.This model gives an accuracy of 95.9% and precision of 92.6%.
After creation of models,run the model using the rum boutton in the bottom side.After running successfully,we can score and evaluate the corresponding model.

# DEPLOYMENT MODEL

Deplying the model by Setting to web service in Machine Learning Studio.If we are doing for the first time .select update predictive experiment.After deployment it is ready to use in webs.

# Consumption options:

Excel 2010 or earlier Request-Response web app template are used here respectively.
